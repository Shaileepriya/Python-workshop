First of all Thank You Atul sir

So I'm from Electrical engineering department and it's my first time that I learn any language And trust me it's very difficult for me as I don't even know basics but thanks to sir,now I can say that I have the knowledge of GitHub, Python. I'm not saying i become pro at this as it will achieve by practice and also we all know python is not that easy which can be learned in only 10 days but i can say, now i know the basics & i know how to learn.    
           
                                                                THANK YOU ATUL SIR
